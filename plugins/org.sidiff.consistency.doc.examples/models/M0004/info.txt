Rule Note: [OO-SPL modelling of the focused case study]

Cite A:		In general, we should be able to check for consistency between the structural models
			and the behavior models. For example, all messages in the sequence diagrams should be
			defined as operation names in the class diagram and should appear as triggers or actions
			in the state diagrams. Moreover, any guards on the messages in sequence diagrams and
			state diagrams should involve attributes that have been defined in the class diagram.
			----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cite B:		Triggers and actions typically correspond to operation definitions in a class; and a 
			guard is usually a boolean expression involving one or more attributes defined in the 
			classes.
