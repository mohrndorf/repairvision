«Implementation Class»

The implementation of a class in some programming language (e.g., C++, Smalltalk,
Java) in which an instance may not have more than one class. This is in contrast to Class,
for which an instance may have multiple classes at one time and may gain or lose classes
over time, and an object (a child of instance) may dynamically have multiple classes. An
Implementation class is said to realize a Classifier if it provides all of the operations
defined for the Classifier with the same behavior as specified for the Classifier's
operations. An Implementation Class may realize a number of different Types. Note that
the physical attributes and associations of the Implementation class do not have to be the
same as those of any Classifier it realizes and that the Implementation Class may provide
methods for its operations in terms of its physical attributes and associations. See also:
